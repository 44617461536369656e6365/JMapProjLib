JMapProjLib
===========

Java Map Projection Library

A partial Java port of the PROJ.4 map projection library. Most projections are implemented, but datum conversion support is lacking. EPSG parameter support is preliminary and contains bugs. Usage of EPSG with JMapProjLib is not currently recommended. 

JMapProjLib currently has various [bugs](https://github.com/OSUCartography/JMapProjLib/issues). Please let us know if you find undocumented bugs.

Original port by Jerry Huxtable www.jhlabs.com, now maintained by the [Cartography and Geovisualization Group](http://cartography.oregonstate.edu), Oregon State University.

A Netbeans project is included, but only the demo application in [src/ch/ethz/karto](src/ch/ethz/karto) uses the Netbeans GUI builder.
