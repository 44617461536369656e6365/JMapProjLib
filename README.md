Java Map Projection Library

A partial Java port of the PROJ.4 map projection library. Most projections are implemented, but datum conversion support is lacking. EPSG parameter support is preliminary and contains bugs.

JMapProjLib currently has various [bugs](https://github.com/OSUCartography/JMapProjLib/issues). Please post an [issue](https://github.com/OSUCartography/JMapProjLib/issues) if you find undocumented bugs.

Original port by Jerry Huxtable www.jhlabs.com, now maintained by the [Cartography and Geovisualization Group](http://cartography.oregonstate.edu), Oregon State University.
